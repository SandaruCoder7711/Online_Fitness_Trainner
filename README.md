See a slideshow of fitness-related images to enhance visual appeal.

Read multiple customer feedback entries in styled review boxes.

Submit their own reviews using a simple input form.

Experience responsive and interactive design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Key features I implemented:

Custom scrollbars and styled layout using CSS.

Review display using flexbox for responsiveness.

Clean and user-friendly UI to encourage user engagement.
